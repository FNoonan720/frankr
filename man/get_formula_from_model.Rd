\title{Extract Formula from Model}
\usage{
get_formula_from_model(model, df_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object with coefficients (e.g., from lm(), glm())}

\item{df_name}{Character. The name of the data frame used in the model (for variable reference)}
}
\value{
Character string representing the mathematical formula of the model
}
\description{
Creates a readable formula string from a fitted model object.
This function constructs a mathematical expression from model coefficients.
}
\details{
This function iterates through model coefficients to build a string formula
representing the model. It starts with the intercept and adds each coefficient term
with its associated variable name.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple linear model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)

# Get the formula as a string
formula_str <- get_formula_from_model(model, "mtcars")
print(formula_str)

}
