It expects a JSON response with a "resultSets" element, from which it extracts the specified
result set and converts it to a data frame.

The function includes built-in rate limiting and automatic retries on transient errors
(HTTP 429, 503, 504). It uses predefined NBA.com headers to mimic legitimate browser requests.
