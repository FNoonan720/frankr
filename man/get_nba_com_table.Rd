\description{
Retrieves data from NBA.com's stats API by sending a request with specified parameters.
This function is designed to work with the NBA.com stats endpoint and returns tabular data.
}
\details{
This function sends a GET request to the NBA.com API with the provided URL and parameters.
It expects a JSON response with a "resultSets" element, from which it extracts the specified
result set and converts it to a data frame.

The function uses predefined NBA.com headers to mimic legitimate browser requests. Note that
while this function doesn't properly handle all API endpoints (it works for most, which is why
I have left it as-is), it provides a good starting point for many common NBA.com API requests.
