\title{Calculate Average of Remaining Sample}
\usage{
remaining_sample_avg(entire_weight, entire_value, sample_weight, sample_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{entire_weight}{Numeric. The total weight of the complete dataset}

\item{entire_value}{Numeric. The total value of the complete dataset}

\item{sample_weight}{Numeric. The weight of the sample to remove}

\item{sample_value}{Numeric. The total value of the sample to remove}
}
\value{
Numeric. The average value of the remaining sample after subtraction
}
\description{
Computes the average value of the remaining portion after removing a weighted sample.
This is useful for calculating how removing certain data points affects the overall average.
}
\details{
This function calculates what the average would be if you removed a specific weighted
sample from the total dataset. It's commonly used in statistics when analyzing the impact of
subsets on overall calculations.
}
\examples{
# If you have a dataset with total weight 100 and total value 500,
# and you want to know the average after removing a sample of weight 20 with value 120
remaining_avg <- remaining_sample_avg(100, 500, 20, 120)
print(remaining_avg)  # Should output 4.75
